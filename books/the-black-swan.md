## Summary

Most of history is driven by singularly meaningful events deemed **"Black Swans"**. These events have truly outsize impact: think WWII, Great Depression, discovery of penicillin. The events go largely unpredicted, but are then assigned some kind of post-hoc historical narrative. 

People are deluded by history. **NNT** (Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the author) lays out a _"triplet of opacity"_ that supposedly explains our species' history problem:

1. **The illusion of understanding**: the world is complicated and random, but we nonetheless convince ourselves we understand it
2. **The retrospective distortion**: we are only able to assess history _after it has happened_, so it appears orderly, and appears to have a clear & understandable chain of causation.
3. **Overvaluation of facts**: we are too easily convinced that things are "true." We rely extensively on experts who are often even _less_ reliable and knowledgeable than "ordinary" people. We have a tendency to come up with "Platonic" categories for the world, even though the world doesn't **actually** map onto these categories.

So-called experts are so handicapped by narrow and incorrect beliefs that placing any trust in them is dangerous. 

People are bad at prediction, mostly because prediction is difficult or impossible. NNT considers a turkey trying to predict what the following day will bring. Up until the week of Thanksgiving, the turkey correctly predicts a fine day with plenty of food. But on the Monday before Thanksgiving, the turkey is slaughtered. 

In the general case, there is simply not enough information to make correct predictions. In almost every case, you cannot know what process is governing some random events. 

Most meaningful events are governed by a "scalable" type of randomness termed "Mandelbrotian randomness" by NNT.
The main characteristic of the so-called scalable randomness is its self-similarity, or scale invariance: the distribution of samples from any range
of the possible values are all governed by the same rule. Equivalently, the randomness is fractal in nature.

NNT gives a specific example of a quantity that is scalably random: wealth of humans. Take a sample of wealth amongst the entire population and observe 
that substantially all of the wealth is held by the top 1% of the sample. Now sample the wealthiest 0.5% of the population. Again, most of the wealth 
of this tiny, ultra-rich sliver is also held by the top 1% of _that_ sample.

NNT's disdain for experts seems mostly to come from their over-reliance on the Gaussian distribution to model randomness. The Gaussian is not scalably random. Subject to a Gaussian distribution, nearly all events fall within some well-known band. Singular events do not have a substantial effect on the average of the outcomes because very large events are just astronomically unlikely.

In an ironic twist, NNT platonically categorizes all types of randomness into two buckets: **Extremistan** and **Mediocristan.** Extremistan is governed by scalable (fractal, Mandelbrotian) randomness, and Mediocristan by non-scalable (Gaussian, Poisson -type) randomness.

In order for a process to be non-scalable, there needs to be some **strong limiting or damping factor** (like gravity) that drives all of the events toward some mean. Processes of this form include **heights of people**, **number of clients of plumbers**. 

Several biases and fallacies worsen our vulnerability to Black Swans.

* Confusing **no evidence of Black Swans** for **evidence of no Black Swans**
* **Narrative fallacy**: being over-reliant on narrative explanations for events
* **Ludic fallacy**: assuming processes are governed by predictable, game-style randomness. Not all processes are equivalent to coin tosses.

How do we limit our exposure to Black Swans? **Diligent empiricism**. We _must not_ invent theories for random processes and then attempt to "verify" that the process is indeed governed by the theory (NNT calls this the "top-down" approach). Instead, we must **first observe** the process, and only afterward make any attempt to theorize.

It is _**much**_ easier to disprove a theory than to prove it. In fact, only a single negative observation is needed to disprove something. NNT asks us to be "negative empiricists," and disprove first.

NNT poses a telling example.
> You are given the number sequence "2, 4, 6" and asked to guess the rule generating the sequence.
> You are allowed to ask whether sequences of your choosing match the rule.
> Nearly everyone makes up some rule (e.g. `x = 2n`), picks some n, and asks if the result matches.
> The actual rule is **positive numbers**.
> In order to correctly guess the sequence, you need to **seek negative examples** by asking, e.g.
> _"does -100, 0, 3 match?"_

In fact, predicting the past is sometimes just as difficult as predicting the future.
> Consider an ice cube. From an ice cube, we can (somewhat easily) work out how it will melt. 
> Consider a puddle of water. From the puddle, it is extraordinarily difficult to work out which ice cube produced the puddle

Working "backward" from a result to a process is **extremely difficult.**

In light of the enormous impact of Black Swans, we need to tamper our epistemic confidence. Those of us who believe strongly in the correctness and completeness of our knowledge are "epistimically arrogant." We should strive to be "epistimically humble" and systematically distrust our own knowledge.

NNT introduces the notion **preferential attachment** which explains how some events are in Extremistan. 
Processes with preferential attachment have a significant _cumulative benefit_, i.e. 
entities subject to large outcomes are _more likely_ to be subject to large outcomes in the future.

Examples include **art sales** (due to word of mouth), **book reviews**, and **journalism.**

Not all black swans are bad. Some movies are much more successful than the rest, and investors in 
these films generate outsize returns.

NNT lays out a few concrete steps for how we can take advantage of positive Black Swans and limit
our exposure to negative ones:

1. Learn to distinguish between processes that generate positive and negative Black Swans. If most of the 
rare outcomes are negative and/or unbounded, avoid the process. How do you identify processes with 
positive Black Swans? It should be possible to invest small amounts with tightly bounded losses that
have a chance to generate outsize returns. Examples: venture capital, movies.
2. Don't narrowly focus on precise, local outcomes. Focuses too narrowly will limit your exposure to **positive** Black Swans. Keep yourself open to potential Black Swans without trying to predict them.
3. Seize anything that looks like opportunity. Black Swans are rare! If you see something that looks promising, act on it. Drop everything if you are especially convinced.
4. Governments (and indeed probably all organisations) are terrible predictors. Ignore precise plans from them, especially long term ones (e.g. crop yield 15 years from now).
5. Don't waste your time on people who claim they can predict or forecast.

## The author's biases

NNT is deeply, deeply distrustful of all forms of authority. He is categorically dismissive of "academics" and indeed all "experts."

NNT believes in the inherent superiority of particular ideas (e.g. his "empirical skepticism") and individuals (Mandelbrot, Poincare). He is unapologetic about this superiority, and he explicitly describes his "half of the time" fondness for Nietzsche in the final chapter. He seems to fancy himself an ubermensch. 

It doesn't seem to be ideas themselves that are attractive to NNT -- it's the character of the individuals. He only seems willing to take seriously the opinions of scorned rebels who are similarly distrustful of the academic establishment. 

He facetiously calls upon the reader to put rats down the shirts of academics. The work has a kind of conspiratorial tone: "you and I know some deep secret. Now let's lord it over these pathetic academics."
