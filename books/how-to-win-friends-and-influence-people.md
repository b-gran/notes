## Summary

A lot of instinctive human behavior is pathological. We will accidentally undermine our own relationships (and status!) if we aren't careful to subdue our base instincts. **DC** (Dale Carnegie, the author) proposes new healthy and productive habits in place.

Underlying most of the advice is DC's belief that **positive reinforcement is more effective than negative for all behavioral change.** This idea was (at the time) partially substantiated by research, and moreso now.

Most of the book points out instances of negative reinforcement and gives some examples of using a positively reinforcing method instead.

### The main principles

When we **like** other people, we do favors for them. We go out of our way to help them and reward them. We have long memories when it comes to kindness and generosity. 

Whenever we want something from others, we must first **convince the other person to like us.** After that, it is often a simple matter to ask the person for the thing we want.

We also like to **maintain a consistent model of ourself in our mind.** If someone believes he is the type of person to give gifts to others, he will **modify his behavior to match this model:** namely, he will give more gifts to others.

We can take advantage of this tendency to be consistent. If we suggest to someone that they are **the type of person** to do some behavior (and this person also likes and trusts us), then they will adjust their behavior to align with the suggestion. 

We shouldn't ask for things directly, if it can be avoided. Instead we should:

1. Convince the person to like us. This step is most important. We should invest heavily here and **sincerely like them back,** taking an honest interest in them.
2. If the person doesn't already know what we want, we should make what we want clear **without asking for it.**
3. If necessary, appeal to the person's consistency by suggesting they are the type of person who **does the thing we want.**

### Handling people, in general

##### 1. Don't give criticism, condemnation, or complaints

People respond badly to criticism - in some cases, exceptionally badly. It's difficult to predict how somehow will respond to criticism you levy against them. People also have long memories. A single instance of criticism (left 
untouched) may damage a relationship for years.

Criticism is extremely risky and **almost never rewarding.** DC suggests we _never_ give direct<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> criticism. 

If there is a way to make some behavior change by praising the person for _not_ doing whatever motivated the criticism, we should praise instead. 

Even if we feel the criticism is warranted but cannot think of a way to praise, DC suggests we just leave the matter alone. We should try to win the friendship and/or respect of this person, and circle back to the matter of the criticism later.

##### 2. Give honest and sincere appreciation

People respond extremely well to compliments and appreciation -- as long as it's sincere. We should make every effort to recognize the people around us, as long as the recognition is sincere.

There is a line here: people will detect cheap and insincere flattery, and it will backfire.

##### 3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.

People do things when they feel internally motivated to do them. When we engender this motivation in others, we can convince them to change their behavior.

To engender this motivation, DC suggests we appeal to consistency. To motivate an underperforming member of one's team, one might tell this person how they are a natural leader and then ask them to set an example for the rest of the team -- outlining the behaviors they should be demonstrating (the very ones they're underperforming at).

### How to convince people to like you

Be friendly, smiley, and attentive. People will be naturally to you.

Remembering and correctly pronouncing people's names is very important. The stakes are modestly high: repeatedly or badly screwing someone's name up may make a lasting impression.

Others (by and large) do not care or know what you want, or what your perspective is. But they are _very_ aware of their own wants and perspective. Appeal to this by understanding their perspective and talking in terms of the person's interests.

Usually, let others do the talking. Pay attention and be genuinely interested in them. 

##### 1. Become genuinely interested in other people.

##### 2. Smile.

##### 3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

##### 4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.

##### 5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests.

##### 6. Make the other person feel important -- and do it sincerely.


### How to win people to your way of thinking

Arguing with people is futile and counterproductive. 

Instead, convince the other person to like you. Take an honest interest in them, be an active & sympathetic listener, and don't talk very much. Then, have them agree with you repeatedly (on minor points, usually). Once they have convinced themselves that you are a good person, and are convinced they agree with you in general, they will **naturally** come to agree on the point of discussion.

DC gives a two options for enhancing the appeal to friendship and consistency: **dramatisation** and **challenges**. If you act out your point, it's more likely to stick. You may also appeal to the other person's natural competitiveness (but you should not pit people against one another).

##### 1. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

##### 2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say "You're wrong."

##### 3. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.

##### 4. Begin in a friendly way.

##### 5. Get the other person to say 'yes, yes' immediately.

##### 6. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.

##### 7. Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.

##### 8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.

##### 9. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.

##### 10. Appeal to the nobler motives.

##### 11. Dramatise your ideas.

##### 12. Throw down a challenge.


### As a leader: how to change people's behavior

In line with the other steps, avoid directly criticising. Always begin your attempts at behavior change by convincing the person to like you, and then praising and appreciating them.

Others are unlikely to change their behavior at the request of someone they don't like.

When you must deliver criticism or point out mistakes, do so indirectly and **let the person save face.** Point out their good reputation and acknowledge whatever externalities caused or influenced the mistake.

When you want behavior change, don't punish bad behaviors. Instead, **positively reinforce** the new behavior and reward every small improvement.

Don't make behavior change seem difficult or daunting. Make it seem very easy. When people feel like behavior change is very difficult, or if they feel like they personally can't manage it, they may not even bother.

##### 1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.

##### 2. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.

##### 3. Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person.

##### 4. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.

##### 5. Let the other person save face.

##### 6. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be 'hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.'

##### 7. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.

##### 8. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.

##### 9. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

<a name="f1">1</a>: Carnegie qualifies this in the section on leadership.  Indirect criticism is sometimes necessary, and he gives guidelines for such criticism.
